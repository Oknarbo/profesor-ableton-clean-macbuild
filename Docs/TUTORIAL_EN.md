### Learning & Explanations

```
"What is sidechain compression?"

AI: "Sidechain compression is a technique where a compressor on one 
channel reacts to the signal from another channel. The most common 
example is the 'pumping' effect in dance music where the bass 'ducks' 
(reduces) every time the kick hits..."
```

### Troubleshooting

```
"My track is too quiet, what should I do?"

AI: "Let me help you boost the volume. I'll:
1. Check the master fader
2. Add a Utility device for gain staging
3. Suggest using a limiter..."
```

### Creative Ideas

```
"I have a drum loop on track 1. Give me melody ideas."

AI: "Great! Based on your drum loop, here are some ideas:
1. Try a minor pentatonic scale melody
2. Add arpeggiated chords
3. Use a call-and-response pattern..."
```

## Learning Production

Profesor Abelton is excellent for learning! Here's how:

### Ask Anything

```

### Practical Lessons

```
"Teach me how to use EQ"

AI: "Great! Let's learn EQ hands-on. I'll:
1. Create a track with an audio loop
2. Add EQ Eight
3. Show you what each band does..."
```

### Genre-Specific Advice
